Goals of LightMVC:

1. Speed
2. Security
3. Ability to integrate with 3rd party libraries w/o having to jump through hoops
4. Handle errors nicely
5. Follow good design patterns seen in j2ee

Events:
- Let user put an id in the controller of the clicked component, e.g. id of a button.
- Doing that registers click with an event...that way you don't have server generated views.
